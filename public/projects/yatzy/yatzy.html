            For CSI 3140, we were tasked with creating a game of Yatzy on the web. We utilized skills we learned throughout the course via lectures and labs. 
            The game includes a start page, the main gameplay page, score keeping mechanisms, leaderboard and an end game page. You can find a link to the Github repository 
            that contains all the code to run the game by clicking the button above!

                        In order to implement Yatzy, we used HTML and CSS to create the UI and Javascript to code the logic.
                        We kept a fairly simple UI, with the main features being the dice and the score board table to keep track of points. We used the table
                        component for easy formatting, and used contrasting colors for an appealing design.
                        For the logic, we divided the code into smaller parts such as the dice logic, gameplay, and UI interactions, and brought them together
                        in the main game engine.
                        We also briefly used Node JS for debugging the logic when were yet to create the UI.

                        For the second version, we made use of PHP and AJAX calls to asynchronously update parts of the game.
                        We still used HTML and CSS to create the UI, but Javascript was used solely to update the UI, rather than for logic.
                        We kept the UI the same, but we added a leaderboard for players to keep track of their scores.
                        We re-implemented the logic in PHP in the same structure as the Javascript code in V1. The Javascript code would make asynchronous
                        calls to the PHP in order to call the logic functions. We also stored the state of the game using PHP sessions.

                        Vivian was tasked with developing the main game engine, which involved calculating scores for each category every roll, 
                        tabulating total scores, keeping track of dice rerolls, creating the leaderboard and providing the actual game rules and mechanics.<br>
                        Anika was tasked with developing some of the dice mechanics, the UI, most of the api calls and some of the logic that interacted with the UI. This established 
                        a connection between the frontend and backend, and allowed Vivian to seemlessly incorporate the engine.

                        While the majority of development went smoothly, we did encounter a few challenges. We began with developing the backend Javascript portion,
                        but had trouble with organizing the code into logical components. We initially coded modules in seperate files, including one for the dice and 
                        and one for the game state. However, we realized we needed to run a local server in order to export and import them. 
                        Instead, we decided to just have a Dice and Game variable to encompass all the associated functions. This allowed us to encapsulate 
                        functionality while keeping the implementation simple.
                        The rest of the development progressed with very few errors, with the only troubles occuring with minor logic errors that were easy to 
                        detect and fix.

                        With version 2, the major challenges that we encountered were the api calls, as we did not have a full understanding of how they were to be implemented. 
                        We used $_SESSSION and error_log() to help us debug any problems that arose, which allowed us to locate and fix issues more easily. 
                        For example, we used $_SESSION to understand the format of the data, what data is being returned from the php functions, and whether it is being updated
                        properly or not. We also used error_log() in api.php to get the data returned from the php file.

            Here is an outline of how Yatzy works, and how it is played in our implementation of it.
            <br><br><b>Goal</b>: Obtain as many points as possible by rolling certain configurations of dice. Each configuration has an associated category which gives
            a certain number of points outlined in the table below. For example, rolling 3 twos can score the player 6 points.
            Some configurations may have more than one possible category, but once a category is filled, it cannot be used again, so players must choose wisely.
            <br><br><b>How to Play</b>:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Player rolls all 5 of their dice by clicking "Roll"
                    <br>
                    <img class="full-img" src="before_roll.png">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Player may reroll some dice up to 3 times, if they wish, by clicking on dice to select them and then clicking "Reroll"
                    <br>
                    <img class="full-img" src="before_reroll.png">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the player is satisfied with their rolls or runs out of rolls, they will click on an empty category in the score table 
                    to submit their score. 0 points may be obtained if the dice rolls do not fit an available category!
                    <br>
                    <img class="full-img" src="before_score_submit.png">
                    <img class="full-img" src="after_score_submit.png">
                </li>
                <li>The next turn starts and the same process is repeated</li>
                <li>
                    The game is over once the player has filled all categories, and their score is then tabulated. Then window will ask for a name to add to the leaderboard.
                    <br>
