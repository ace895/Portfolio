            For CSI 3140, we were tasked with creating a game of Yatzy on the web. We utilized skills we learned throughout the course via lectures and labs. 
            The game includes a start page, the main gameplay page, score keeping mechanisms, and an end game page. You can find a link to the Github repository 
            that contains all the code to run the game by clicking the button above!

                        In order to implement Yatzy, we used HTML and CSS to create the UI and Javascript to code the logic.
                        We kept a fairly simple UI, with the main features being the dice and the score board table to keep track of points.
                        For the logic, we divided the code into smaller parts such as the dice logic, gameplay, and UI interactions, and brought them together
                        in the main game engine.
                        We also briefly used Node JS for debugging the logic when were yet to create the UI.
                        Vivian mainly worked on the game engine, while Anika developed some of the dice mechanics as well as the majority of the 
                        UI and some bridges between the frontend and backend that Vivian used to connect the UI to the game engine.

            If you don't know how Yatzy works, here is a brief summary.
            <br><br><b>Goal</b>: Obtain as many points as possible by rolling certain configurations of dice. Each configuration has an associated category which gives
            a certain number of points outlined in the table below. For example, rolling 3 twos can score the player 6 points.
            Some configurations may have more than one possible category, but once a category is filled, it cannot be used again, so players must choose wisely.
            <br><br><b>How to Play</b>:
            <ol>
                <li>Player rolls all 5 of their dice by clicking "Roll"</li>
                <li>Player may roll each dice up to 3 times, if they wish, by clicking on an individual dice</li>
                <li>
                    Once the player is satisfied with their rolls or runs out of rolls, they will click on an empty category in the score table 
                    to submit their score. 0 points may be obtained if the dice rolls do not fit an available category!
                </li>
                <li>The next turn starts and the same process is repeated</li>
                <li>The game is over once the player has filled all categories, and their score is then tabulated</li>
            </ol>
