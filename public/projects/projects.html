            Suika means Watermelon in Japanese. The original game tasks players with merging two of the same fruit to produce another fruit, 
            with the final fruit being a watermelon. My rendition of the game uses cats rather than fruit, because I thought cats were cuter.

                The equation is used to determine the position of the next cat in my suika game, with constraints.
                The contraints are very basic ones: applying gravity, border constraints, and collision with other cats.

            <p> <b>Goal:</b> The aim of the game is to merge cute cats and see how many points you can get.<br>
                You can click to spawn cats at the top of the screen which will drop and merge them with other cats of the same kind. <br>
                If the cat goes beyond the screen, you lose. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Point System: </b> For every merge, you get (2 * cat level) added to your points. When you merge two of the smallest cat, you get 2 points, when you merge two of the second smallest, you get 4, and so on.<br>
                Here is a short demo of the game:
