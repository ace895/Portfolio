            Suika means Watermelon in Japanese. The game is given its name because when you merge fruits together, the final fruit is a watermelon. My rendition of the game is to use cats because I thought cats were cuter.

                    The equation is used to determine the next position of the cat's in my suika game, with constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The contraints are very basic ones: applying gravity, border constraints and collision with other cat's.

                <p> You are basically going to merge cute cats and see how much points you can get.</p>
                <p> 
                    There will be a few cats that will pop up that can drop but the other cats must be merged to get. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    If the cat goes above the screen. Basically, try to spawn to cats at the same time. You lose.

                <p>
                    <b>Point System: </b> For ever merge, you get 2 * the level added into your points. so the smallest cat will give you 2 when you merge them and so on.
